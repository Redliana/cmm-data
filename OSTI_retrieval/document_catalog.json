    "description": "Nd-Fe-B based magnets have the highest energy product among all permanent magnets, which is required for numerous clean energy technologies. For higher temperature applications (T > 150\u00b0C), additions of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) such as Dy are required to maintain sufficient coercivity during operation. Additions of Dy are expensive. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the need for HREEs by reducing the grain size to the nanoscale, which increases the coercivity and decreases its temperature",

We then highlight some of the recent work that has been done by several national labs (National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Critical Minerals Institute (CMI)) on recycling rare earth elements from end-of-life hard disk drives (EOL). Then, we mention our long-term plan to design a feedstock agnostic process to recov",

For the quantification of critical elements, traditional methods such as acid digestion are time-intensive and can fail to dissolve critical elements in refractory minerals. One potential solution is to adopt alkaline fusion for faster, total digestion. However, the role of flux choice and",

Secondary sources like phosphogypsum, coal fly ash, used nuclear fuel, and electronic waste are concentrated sources of critical minerals. One strategy for a resilient supply chain is to decentralize sourcing and hydrometallurgical processing of metals. Rotating packed beds (RPBs) for solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction are gaining momentum for their ability to increase process throughput by 5-10x ",

The microscope is strong-coupling in the sense that electron wavefunctions in the quantum dot can directly overlap with electron wavefunctions in the sample, in contrast to probes based on electric-field coupling. The SQDM consists of a sharp glass probe with two asymmetric electrodes leading",

    "description": "Removing grown device layers from a GaAs substrate is an essential aspect of reducing costs of III\u2013V photovoltaics. While many methods of device layer removal have been explored, Sonic Lift\u2010off (SLO) demonstrates novel control of the stress conditions within the substrate during exfoliation. By utilizing acoustic energy, this technique allows for a lower maximum stress required to fully lift\u2010off layers from a substrate. We demonstrate that this technique results in no damage to inverted\u2010grown an",

Even though REEs have been found in more than 200 minerals, only bastnaesite, monazite and xenotime are commercially exploited for REE extraction.

    "description": "Further improvements to lithium-ion and emerging battery technologies can be enabled by an improved understanding of the chemistry and working mechanisms of interphases that form at electrochemically active battery interfaces. However, it is difficult to collect and interpret spectra of interphases for several reasons, including the presence of a variety of compounds. To address this challenge, we herein present a vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data library of ten compounds that ",

Current open- and closed-loop recycling strategies often focus on recovering individual components, making the reuse of mixed cathode materials a complex challenge. Meanwhile, the research on upcycling has been limited to using pristine cathode feedstocks and virgin materials for synthesis. Here, to address this issue, we present an upcycling approach for spent Ni-lean mixed cathode materials that",

    "description": "A third-integer resonant slow extraction system is being developed for Fermilab's Delivery Ring to deliver protons to the upcoming Mu2e experiment. The timescale of the extraction (or spill) duration is 43 milliseconds, which is extremely short and unprecedented. Additionally, the experiment's strict and challenging requirements on the quality of the spill at this time scale has led to the development of a new Spill Regulation System (SRS) design. The SRS primarily consists of three components -",

    "description": "One of the most pressing challenges to the continued deployment of nuclear energy systems is in the ultimate management and disposition of discharged fuel assemblies. While reprocessing and recovery of valuable materials from UNF assemblies has been considered as part of an overall strategy for minimization of the volume of reactor-based wastes to be managed, the deployment of commercial-scale reprocessing facilities presents an enormous economic challenge. The MARIE software package has been de",

Lead times for these materials have extended to over 24 months, placing significant stress on the reliability of attaining these alloys. This situation is exacerbated by the supplier\u2019s minimum purchase requirement of excessively large quantities to meet unique purchase order (PO) requirements which is usually above the maximum requirements of Sandia National",

The muons are produced from pions generated in a production target when it is hit by an 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster/Main Injector. The proton target design space is strongly constrained by a one-year operating lifetime and the need for radiative cooling in a vacuum environment. Uncertainties in the li",

It has been long identified that fouling of heat exchangers is a persistent cause of up to 2.5% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Unfortunately, practice has also demonstrated that unless a powerful economic driver exists to encourage preemptive mitigation of fouling, there will always be a strong ",

We estimated that our process technology can reduce energy consumption by 45% compared to the blast furnace process and ~15% compared to the DRI process. Steel manufactu",

The steel making process has inherent CO2 emissions from mineral conversion and is considered major contributors to the global carbon emissions. The steel industry is responsible for 8% of global carbon emissions. The main objective of this research project is to execute and complete a front-end engineering an",
